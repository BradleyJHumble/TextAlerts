# TextAlerts
<bold>What is it? </bold>: An simple rest api that sends texts messages using the twilio api

<bold>First</bold> download github respository using command below

git clone "https://github.com/BradleyJHumble/TextAlerts.git"

<bold>Next </bold>you have to download the npm requirements so you do the next command:

npm install

<bold>You will need to change some lines to your twilio account information in app.js </bold>

More information is in the file of what to put

<bold>Next</bold> to get the server running locally you run:

node app.js

<bold>Lastly</bold> to test it out you can post to localhost:3000/TextAlerts/(Number you are sending to)/(Your message)/(Any images links)

I suggest using "Advance Rest Client" extension for Chrome for testing purposes, you can download it at the link below:
